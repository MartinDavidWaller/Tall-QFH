# Tall-QFH

This details my build of the Tall QFH antenna found here - http://metsat.gogan.org/ant_qha.htm. 

I decided to add collars around the 1 1/4" tube where the 8mm copper pipe passes through.
The idea being to add strength and ease build as the holes in the collars can be used to direct drill bits.

The collars are 3D printed and were designed using OpenSCAD - https://openscad.org/

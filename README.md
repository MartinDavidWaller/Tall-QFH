# Tall-QFH

This details my build of the Tall QFH antenna found here - http://metsat.gogan.org/ant_qha.htm.

I decided to add collars around the 1 1/4" tube where the 8mm copper pipe passes through.
The idea being to add strength and ease build as the holes in the collars can be used to direct drill bits.

The collars are 3D printed and were designed using OpenSCAD - https://openscad.org/

The top collar slips over the 1 1/4" tube, has ports for four 8mm copper pipes, and one hole for a 3mm self tapping screw.

The connections block slides into the tube and holds the ends of the four copper tubes. This stops any unnecessary contact
between the tubes and has 3mm holes to accept self tapping screws.

When inserted this looks like:

At the bottom are two single collars, in each case the copper pipe passes straight through the collar and the 1 1/4" tube.

To aid alignment around the 1 1/4" tube there is also a "Hole Pattern". It has holes every 45 degrees and can be used to ensure that
the collars are at the correct angle.

The final build looks like:
